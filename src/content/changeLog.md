# New Update!

_v1.1.0: Editing & Refactoring_

This new update is primarily focused on code refactoring on features and functions to more consistent and probably
more performance-efficient methods and missing basic features. <span class="comment">Because apparently we weren't able to do them on the initial release.</span>

### New Features

- Added new pop-up, like this one that you're reading, to inform new features and bugfixes.
- Now tasks and sub-tasks can ~~finally~~ be edited.
- Tasks now can be moved through the list. <span class="comment">_(no need to delete everything to reorganize again!)_</span>
