## About

</div>

ToToday is a single-page app created to help you with your daily tasks in a more simple but organized way,
so you don't get lost or forget what to do in the day and can focus on the tasks themselves.

##### Development:

The app is created with [Vue][vue] and the [Nuxt.js][nuxtjs] framework, being a PWA,
it works mostly on the frontend side, using the browser's local storage to keep the task list storage.
The color palette used is the [CuppCat][cuppcat] theme, based on the [Catppuccin][catppuccin] theme,
icons provided by [Iconoir][iconoir].

> Even already being published and on the 1.0.0, it's still in
> development and will be more polished and have more features and
> functionalities. You can see all the planned things for future
> updates on the [projects tab][projects].
